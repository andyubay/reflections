When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It allows team working. It is also useful to back up work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes you may not want your work to be public as it is not ready for others to see. You may still need the functionality of Git

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are when you want to change someone elses public repository but do not have permission. Clones are when you make your own local copy either from Github or a local directory. Branches exist within the repository. They are used to try out new features or make different version of the same program

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It allows us to know whether the remote and the local are in sync or not.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

You could email code back and forth and agree to work on certain sections. One could also host using cloud such as Dropbox or OneDrive. There would be less to learn using these latter systems but it would make it harder to sync code properly

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

You can experiment with different ideas without messing up the main version. You can also share your new idea with friends and colleagues
