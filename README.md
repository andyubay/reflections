# Reflections

This repository contains the reflections I used in the [Udacity's Git & GitHub course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)


## Why Reflect
Reflection is use as it helps us to: 

* Remember information we have just learnt.
* Develop awareness of what we still need to learn.
* Help us digest theoretical information. It helps us be clear about how information fits together.
